## Project Overview

Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory, manage resources, and increase revenue. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast sales based on various features such as historical sales data, promotions, store information, and more.

### Objectives
- Analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict sales.
- Deploy the model for practical use in forecasting future sales.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [Kaggle's Sales Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data). It contains the following features:
- **Date:** The date of the sale.
- **Store:** The store where the sale took place.
- **Item:** The item that was sold.
- **Sales:** The number of units sold.

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git
    cd sales-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   The `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` notebook contains the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset.

2. **Model Training:**  
   Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model using the processed dataset:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
