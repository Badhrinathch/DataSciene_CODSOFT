Data Science Projects


This repository contains implementations of three data science projects: Iris Flower Classification, Titanic Survival Prediction, and Credit Card Fraud Detection. Each project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.Projects Overview1. Iris Flower ClassificationObjective: Classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.Dataset: The Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.Techniques Used:Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)Data PreprocessingModel Training using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision TreesModel Evaluation2. Titanic Survival PredictionObjective: Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, fare, and class.Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.Techniques Used:Data Cleaning and PreprocessingFeature EngineeringModel Training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient BoostingModel Evaluation and Cross-Validation3. Credit Card Fraud DetectionObjective: Detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions.Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.Techniques Used:Data Balancing (SMOTE)Feature Selection and EngineeringModel Training using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural NetworksModel Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
